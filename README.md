# Beginner to Ninja Backend Projects Using Django

This repository contains a collection of beginner to advanced backend projects developed using Django, based on the project ideas from [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas). The purpose of this repository is to practice and enhance backend development skills by building real-world projects, focusing on a range of topics that are crucial for mastering backend development.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a structured way for developers to practice and improve their backend development skills by building advanced projects. Each project covers important concepts such as:

- API Development
- Authentication and Authorization
- Database Design and Optimization
- Asynchronous Processing
- Caching and Performance Tuning
- Microservices Architecture
- WebSocket Implementation

These projects are built using **Django**, a powerful web framework for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient backend systems. By following the project ideas from Roadmap.sh, developers can challenge themselves with real-world problems and sharpen their skills in various aspects of backend development.

## Projects Covered

The repository aims to implement the following backend projects inspired by [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas):

1. **URL Shortener**: A system to shorten long URLs, with custom aliases and analytics tracking.
2. **File Sharing Service**: A secure service that allows users to upload, share, and manage files.
3. **Authentication System**: A robust system that handles user registration, login, and session management with JWT.
4. **Social Media Platform**: A basic version of a social media site where users can post, comment, and interact.
5. **Chat Application**: A real-time chat application using Django Channels and WebSockets.
6. **Task Queue System**: A system for background job processing, using Django and a task queue like Celery.
7. **Blog Platform**: A multi-user blogging platform with advanced features like content management, tagging, and commenting.
8. **E-Commerce System**: A fully functional e-commerce site with user authentication, product management, and payment integration.

... and more!

## Technologies Used

The projects are primarily built using:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database used for storing and managing project data.
- **Docker**: For containerization, allowing easy setup and deployment of each project.
- **Redis**: For caching and handling asynchronous tasks (used in specific projects).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgPriyanshu/backend-projects.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and follow the specific setup instructions for each project, which are included in the respective directories.

3. Run the projects locally using:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
